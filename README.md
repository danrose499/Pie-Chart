# Pie-Chart
Pie-Chart uses a custom Java shape hierarchy and color enum (from the MyShape repository). An object of the HistogramAlphaBet class reads a text file ("Alice.txt" in this example, containing the story to Alice in Wonderland) and creates a map with of all the letters (as the values) and their respective frequencies (as the keys) and sorts by keys to print a Pie Chart. Using the created GUI, the user can select how many of the most common letters to print on the pie chart, and it is updated accordingly, as seen below:
